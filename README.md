Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
====================================================

Introduction
------------
This contains my work for the Getting an Cleaning Data course project.


This project includes the following files:
------------------------------------------

- 'run_analysis.R': This is the script that I have created to merge, clean, and manipulate the provided  "UCI HAR Dataset"

- 'tidy.txt': This is the resulting tidy data set that is generated by 'run_analysis.R'

- 'CodeBook.md': This is the file which explains the transformations performed and the resulting data dn variables.

About run_analysis.R
--------------------

The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R script that achieves the following: 

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2) Write the resulting tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The codebook.md file describes the ouput files of run_analysis.R (tidy.txt), the variables, the data, and work that performed to clean up the data

The data used to generate the files in this repository was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. For detailed information about the data see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
