Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
====================================================

Introduction
------------
This contains my work for the Getting an Cleaning Data course project.


This project includes the following files:
------------------------------------------

- 'run_analysis.R': This is the script that I have created to merge, clean, and manipulate the provided  "UCI HAR Dataset"

- 'tidy.txt': This is the resulting tidy data set that is generated by 'run_analysis.R'

- 'CodeBook.md': This is the file which explains the transformations performed and the resulting data dn variables.
